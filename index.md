# About Me

Though I am a results-driven front-end developer by day who have converted inactive designs to fully interactive, well-developed, accessible and standards-based user interfaces. I am completely enthusiast with a full stack environment and passionate about JavaScript world. I have even worn the entrepreneurship hat.
I enjoy traveling, drinking, socializing, reading, helping other people, watching movies, and learning(daily) as much as I intend to work hard.

Also, I like working in a team, you will learn faster and more. As the saying goes: “two heads are better than one”.

I take challenges as inspirations, always looking for improvement, want to be involved in projects that I can be proud of, and join an amazing team and advance my career and friendship.

# About Me

Hello There! I am glad you are in my personal website. I a full-stack developer who is in love with OSS. My main passion is 
UI/UX and Front-End technologies. However, it's not all, I enjoy developing things with Ruby on Rails, 
NodeJS(Express, Sails) and MongoDB. 

Although I used to work with Laravel, no more PHP now, indeed, except WordPress! Javascript and HTML/CSS are my daily routine while EmberJS and Angular2 with TypeScript are my material to build applications. 

Indeed, Scrum is my favorite methodology under Agile umbrella. I may mention Kanban system which is pretty handy when it comes to smaller project in my prespective.  

Recently, I am playing with Go, Ionic, Meteor, Vue.js and would love to learn Elm.

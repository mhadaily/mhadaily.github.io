In this session, I will walk you through the basics of Flutter and Dart such as core concepts, widgets, and possible state management, layout, and more. Last but not least, You will learn the best resources that you will need when developing with Flutter.

On the other hand, Flutter is a new technology for developing beautiful cross-platform mobile/web and embedded apps with a single code base from Google surpassing many similar technologies such as React Native and has been growing very rapidly. Nevertheless, there are many challenges while developing a mobile app, especially with Flutter such as CI/CD to Google Play and AppStore, bumping build or release version automatically, running test, checking code coverage, code style formatting, monitoring, crash analyzer, taking snapshots, running gold tests, code signing and sharing keys among team members effortlessly, writing changelogs. These are just some of the repetitive, time-consuming tasks which may lead an inconsistency too. Although this talk will demonstrate how each of the mentioned challenges can be solved while developing a Flutter app, most of the ideas can be reused for any kind of mobile app development in order to boost productivity as well as developers, stack holders, and client satisfaction.</p>\n","type":"conference","slide":"https://slides.com/mhadaily/applying-devops-in-flutter-mobile-development","website":"https://flutter.ph/#/","date":"18/05/2020","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPlSKRtUc8s","online":true,"gallery":[62]}}},{"node":{"wordpress_id":329,"date":"3 months ago","title":"NTNU students","acf":{"title":"React Workshop","description":"<p>A beginner online workshop organized by Telia Norway for Students in NTNU</p>\n","type":"workshop","slide":"","website":"https://www.ntnu.edu/","date":"06/05/2020","video":"","online":true,"gallery":[66]}}},{"node":{"wordpress_id":326,"date":"3 months ago","title":"Flutter India","acf":{"title":"Scaling Flutter architecture by Leveraging strategic Domain-Driven Design","description":"<p class=\"description\">Architecting software, especially on a large-scale where it needs to meet the business requirements is always a challenge and Flutter apps are not an exception.

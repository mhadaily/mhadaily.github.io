Although learning ember doest not seem easy, it is\na fact that if you get used to it, you are not able to abandon it! I personally believe (as a one year Ember developer), it's by far\none of the best in Front-end technology and should be used for Semi-enterprise to enterprise application where all developers\nare mostly senior. Moreover, finding senior and ember developer should not be that much difficult for the company in order to expand the team in the future. </p>\n<h3 id=\"angular-2\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#angular-2\" aria-label=\"angular 2 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Angular 2</h3>\n<p>Well, it has been designed to mitigate performance, productivity and unique codebase between different platforms.

Super slim and easy to learn. Vue's goal tends to stick on pure javascript object and functionality rather than make that complex.\nHence, Vue's performance has slightly better than other rivals and make that easy to learn and very handy to have a quick project. However, due to less community members and obscured\nroadmap as well as lack of large well-tested application in production, I am still doubtful to say it can be use in enterprise while it is the best to start\nfor small and medium applications. </p>\n<h3 id=\"reactjs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reactjs\" aria-label=\"reactjs permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>React.js</h3>\n<p>Well, nothing to say. It's perfect at every single aspect. Although I personally do not like to write JSX code, I would say it is the\nmost powerful approach that I have seen so far.

However, last but not least, my personal choices would be: 1- Angular, 2- Ember, 3- React and 4- Vue. </p>\n<p>My advice is \"do not spend to much time to choose between one of the frameworks named above, in fact, find the one that is the most desirable and adaptable among team's developers or you feel comfortable the most.\"</p>","fields":{"slug":"which-one-should-i-choose-angular-2-vue-js-react-js-and-ember-js"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Which one should I choose?

I could not make sure they all are capable\nof handling such a massive sql file. I was about to decide witting a migration script with <strong>NodeJS</strong> that\nI finally found <a href=\"http://pgloader.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Pgloader</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tapoueh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Dimitri Fontaine</a>. </p>\n<p>First, It looked to me very promising and I said to myself: \"Yes, this is it.\". Before counting, let me say what is Pgloader. </p>\n<blockquote>pgloader is a data loading tool for PostgreSQL, using the COPY command.\nIts main advantage over just using COPY or \\copy, and over using a Foreign Data Wrapper, is its transaction behaviour, where pgloader will keep a separate file of rejected data, but continue trying to copy good data in your database.\nThe default PostgreSQL behaviour is transactional, which means that any erroneous line in the input data (file or remote database) will stop the entire bulk load for the table.\npgloader also implements data reformatting, a typical example of that being the transformation of MySQL datestamps 0000-00-00 and 0000-00-00 00:00:00 to PostgreSQL NULL value (because our calendar never had a year zero).\n</blockquote>\n<p>I started testing that with different circumstances and all test was pretty good. Therefore, I gave it a try and\nrun the final command to migrate that the result was pretty awesome in my Mac and I was excited though:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Successfully migrated from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MySQL?src=hash\">#MySQL</a> 5 to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PostgreSQL?src=hash\">#PostgreSQL</a> 9.5, roughly 16GB data, thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tapoueh\">@tapoueh</a> for a fantastic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/pgloader?src=hash\">#pgloader</a> tool <a href=\"https://t.co/8lDziCnJqV\">pic.twitter.com/8lDziCnJqV</a></p>&mdash; Majid Hajian (@mhadaily) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mhadaily/status/806763214092414976\">December 8, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Although, everything was pretty good on my local machine while I wanted to do that in our <strong>EC2</strong>, I faced with many difficulties as\nour server was not as perfect as my local machine with a low memory as small as 512MB until I made <a href=\"http://ccl.clozure.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ClozureCL</a> on the Ubuntu as a default\ncompiler for <a href=\"https://www.common-lisp.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Lisp</a> which is written's lagrange of Pgloader and performance was incredibly unbelievable. </p>\n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClozureCL?src=hash\">#ClozureCL</a> instead of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SBCL?src=hash\">#SBCL</a> while migrating <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MySQL?src=hash\">#MySQL</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PostgreSQL?src=hash\">#PostgreSQL</a> with 16GB data on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWS?src=hash\">#AWS</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EC2?src=hash\">#EC2</a> 512MB RAM!!

For RPM based systems, see also the bootstrap-centos7.sh script that prepares your build environment so that building is then just a git clone then make away.</p>\n<p>Building for the <strong>Windows™ Operating System</strong> is easy enough and the platform is fully supported.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mac</strong> <code class=\"language-text\">brew install pgloader</code></li>\n<li><strong>Ubuntu</strong> <code class=\"language-text\">apt-get install pgloader</code></li>\n<li><strong>Docker</strong>: You can also use a docker image for pgloader at <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/dimitri/pgloader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://hub.docker.com/r/dimitri/pgloader/</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ docker pull dimitri/pgloader\n$ docker run --rm --name pgloader dimitri/pgloader:latest pgloader --version\n$ docker run --rm --name pgloader dimitri/pgloader:latest pgloader --help</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Build From Source</strong> Pgloader is now a Common Lisp program, tested using the SBCL (>= 1.1.14) and Clozure CL implementations with Quicklisp.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">apt-get install sbcl unzip libsqlite3-dev make curl gawk freetds-dev libzip-dev\ncd /path/to/pgloader\nmake pgloader\n./build/bin/pgloader --help</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Repository</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">To learn more information</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please feel free to drop me an email if you need more help.</p>\n<h2 id=\"better-performance-with-clozurecl\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#better-performance-with-clozurecl\" aria-label=\"better performance with clozurecl permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Better Performance with ClozureCL</h2>\n<p>One of the important problem that I faced, was low memory and killing process by pgloader on our EC2 which has 512MB ram. So,\nDimitri in one of the issue on Github Suggest to use CCL instead of SBCL so I also recommend to do it as the performance is significantly\nbetter and no issue in dropping process because lack of memory. </p>\n<p>The preferred way to get Clozure CL is via Subversion.

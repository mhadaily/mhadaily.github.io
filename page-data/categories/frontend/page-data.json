All of them are awesome\nand all of their works is highly appreciated. However, at the end of the day, we need to choose one in our team, therefore,\nhere is my opinion. </p>\n<h3 id=\"emberjs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#emberjs\" aria-label=\"emberjs permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Ember.js</h3>\n<p>An awesome framework and as its builders say, it is going to be a SDK for web. Although learning ember doest not seem easy, it is\na fact that if you get used to it, you are not able to abandon it! I personally believe (as a one year Ember developer), it's by far\none of the best in Front-end technology and should be used for Semi-enterprise to enterprise application where all developers\nare mostly senior. Moreover, finding senior and ember developer should not be that much difficult for the company in order to expand the team in the future. </p>\n<h3 id=\"angular-2\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#angular-2\" aria-label=\"angular 2 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Angular 2</h3>\n<p>Well, it has been designed to mitigate performance, productivity and unique codebase between different platforms. Hence, indeed, they did a great job can could achieve their goals.\nAngular's roadmap is very distinctive. One of the main strengths of Angular team is to be backed by Google. However, it's should be considered only for enterprise application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vuejs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#vuejs\" aria-label=\"vuejs permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Vue.js</h3>\n<p>Nothing can be easier than Vue.js. Super slim and easy to learn. Vue's goal tends to stick on pure javascript object and functionality rather than make that complex.\nHence, Vue's performance has slightly better than other rivals and make that easy to learn and very handy to have a quick project. However, due to less community members and obscured\nroadmap as well as lack of large well-tested application in production, I am still doubtful to say it can be use in enterprise while it is the best to start\nfor small and medium applications. </p>\n<h3 id=\"reactjs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reactjs\" aria-label=\"reactjs permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>React.js</h3>\n<p>Well, nothing to say. It's perfect at every single aspect. Although I personally do not like to write JSX code, I would say it is the\nmost powerful approach that I have seen so far. React is a tiny library to manipulate the DOM which fits small project need, whereas it can be powerful enough when it combines with other addons to build a enterprise app. In one word, </p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-do-i-prefer-finally\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#so-what-do-i-prefer-finally\" aria-label=\"so what do i prefer finally permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>So what do I prefer finally?</h2>\n<p>In my perspective, choosing of the above frameworks is completely depends on your projects, the future of that and more importantly\nthe company and the team that you are working with. For some, it's is important to see huge backers and obvious roadmap then you should consider React and Angular2 while others think simplicity is the most important one then\nyou definitely should consider Vue.js. </p>\n<p>Like I said, I am a passionate Javascript developer and I love all of them. However, last but not least, my personal choices would be: 1- Angular, 2- Ember, 3- React and 4- Vue. </p>\n<p>My advice is \"do not spend to much time to choose between one of the frameworks named above, in fact, find the one that is the most desirable and adaptable among team's developers or you feel comfortable the most.\"</p>","id":"97733994-8c9e-5380-b6b0-3eef063adda1","fields":{"slug":"which-one-should-i-choose-angular-2-vue-js-react-js-and-ember-js"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2017-03-12","title":"Which one should I choose?

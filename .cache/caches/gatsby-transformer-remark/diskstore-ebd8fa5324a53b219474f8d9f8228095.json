The reason is that yesterday I spent couple of hours and I built my first Vue.js simple app using\nVux and uiElement in order to compare Vue with React, Angular2 and Ember.js. It's live here:  <a href=\"https://www.majidhajian.com/vue2-shop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Live Demo - Vue.js Shop</a></p>\n<p>In the battle of front-end frameworks, these days, I feel I am confused that how to answer my question about \"which frameworks should I choose?\".\nAs a passionate Javascript developer, it is super tough to choose between the following frameworks or libraries to start a new project. All of them come with pros and cons as well as perfect features that makes you impressed and as confused as you are not able to stick on one. </p>\n<p>I tend to wrap up my research and experiences as

Moreover, finding senior and ember developer should not be that much difficult for the company in order to expand the team in the future. </p>\n<h3 id=\"angular-2\"><a href=\"#angular-2\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Angular 2</h3>\n<p>Well, it has been designed to mitigate performance, productivity and unique codebase between different platforms.

Super slim and easy to learn. Vue's goal tends to stick on pure javascript object and functionality rather than make that complex.\nHence, Vue's performance has slightly better than other rivals and make that easy to learn and very handy to have a quick project. However, due to less community members and obscured\nroadmap as well as lack of large well-tested application in production, I am still doubtful to say it can be use in enterprise while it is the best to start\nfor small and medium applications. </p>\n<h3 id=\"reactjs\"><a href=\"#reactjs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>React.js</h3>\n<p>Well, nothing to say. It's perfect at every single aspect. Although I personally do not like to write JSX code, I would say it is the\nmost powerful approach that I have seen so far.

For some, it's is important to see huge backers and obvious roadmap then you should consider React and Angular2 while others think simplicity is the most important one then\nyou definitely should consider Vue.js. </p>\n<p>Like I said, I am a passionate Javascript developer and I love all of them. However, last but not least, my personal choices would be: 1- Angular, 2- Ember, 3- React and 4- Vue. </p>\n<p>My advice is \"do not spend to much time to choose between one of the frameworks named above, in fact, find the one that is the most desirable and adaptable among team's developers or you feel comfortable the most.\"</p>"}
